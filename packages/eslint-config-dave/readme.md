# eslint-config-dave

Extremely thorough ESLint configuration used by myself. Does not cover formatting, please see my [prettier config](https://npmjs.com/prettier-config-dave). To use, install and write your one-line `.eslintrc`

```json
{ "extends": "dave" }
```

**What's configured out of the box:**

- TypeScript
- Svelte
- React (soon)
- Code in Markdown files
