# Development Notes

In this repo, I have the `packages/next/src/lib/metadata` folder from `vercel/next.js` copied as is into the `src/nextjs` folder. This is committed so that i can read diffs easily.

## Update workflow

- run `bash get-upstream-types.sh`
- check git diffs from `src/nextjs/`
- fix our own code
